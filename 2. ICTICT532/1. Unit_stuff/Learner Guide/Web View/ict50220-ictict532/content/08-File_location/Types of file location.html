    <p>In a small business, the location of sensitive files would be within the business data files. Although both file types would be in would be in the same location, folder structures would differ, with sensitive data being properly secured.</p>
    <p>Let us have a look at a few scenarios where small businesses store their data, keeping in mind that all business models will normally have 3 options – onsite storage, cloud storage, or a mixture of both. Select the arrows to learn more.</p>

    <h3>Micro business with standalone computer</h3>
    <p>This type of business might be a home-based business that does consultancy work, or a business that has a number of service staff but having a single computer that managers and plans all the business activities. </p>
    <p>Data capacity 10GB to 250GB</p>
    <p>The structure of the business could be:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>book keeping application running straight from the vendor’s cloud</li>
    <li>client contacts running through cloud-based application such as Microsoft Outlook</li>
    <li>file storage can be located on the computer or cloud, or synchronised with the cloud.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Small network business up to 10 users</h3>
    <p>This type of business could have a small 5 to 10 user peer-to-peer or server-client network. These types of businesses can range from a small motel complex, retail outlet, small medical clinics, to small engineering firms. </p>
    <p>Data capacity 250GB to 1TB</p>

    <ul>
    <li>book keeping application running straight from the vendor’s cloud</li>
    <li>client contacts running through cloud-based application such as Microsoft outlook</li>
    <li>file storage can be located on a network attached storage (NAS) device, or server, or cloud, or synchronised with the cloud.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Small network business up to 50 users</h3>
    <p>This type of business would have a server-client network. These types of businesses can range from a small business with multiple departments to design centres or application development hubs. </p>
    <p>Data capacity 1TB and above</p>
    <p>The structure of the business could be:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>accounting application running straight from the vendor’s cloud, or server-based</li>
    <li>client contacts running through a cloud-based or server-based application such as a customer relationship management system</li>
    <li>file storage managed through the server via NAS, synchronised with the cloud.</li>

    <p>As you can see from the above scenarios the way that files can be stored can easily vary. This also means that the way that businesses secure sensitive information will also vary depending on where the information is stored.</p>
